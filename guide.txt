These files measure ROA adoption across servers for the TLDs (more or less).
The files geneate charts geared for a talk at APNIC 50.

(See: https://conference.apnic.net/50/assets/files/APCS790/ROA-deployment-at-the-top-of-the-DNS.pdf)

Nevertheless, the code can be run at any time for updated statistics.  Running
for older dates is possible, i.e., the data is available, but the code just
doesn't do that now.

To run:

$ python3 measureroadeployment.py

No arguments are accepted.  "./results" will appear and inside it a directory
whose name looks like a date will appear.  All the generated files will be in there.

The "next day" for the data files happens around 1000 UTC.  The DNS Census Core
takes 8 hours to complete and then more time to be pushed to the public server.

$ python3 zonestohouses.py

This is not meant to be separately run, but it can for the sake of unit testing.
Running this will list the "DNS Houses" identified with some information about
each.

A DNS House is the set of zones that share a collective rname value in their
SOA resource records and Technical Operator information registered with the
IANA functions operator.
